# HW9_JusongCai

In HW9, I continued to create a Harmony project to write a program aiming to output 100 sets of data of accelerometer and gyroscope on Terminal screen on my Mac at 100 Hz every time when I type in "r" in keyboard and the PIC32 then receives the signal.

All the core codes are in the "firmware/src" folder and building files are in the "HW9.X" folder. Probably the hex file and something cannot be reached somehow in the Git because the directory is too deep and I don't know how to fix that, but the codes work fine and you can refer to those codes to accomplish the same results showing in the demo video. The mp4 file shows the demo video of how the output is generated. For other instructions please go to ME433 course repo and instructions/schedule page and you will find more detailed steps and descriptions.

As for the core codes, "ST7735.c/h" represents LCD communication with PIC32 via SPI; "imc.h" and "imu.c" contains IMU communication with PIC32 via I2C; "i2c_master_noint.c/h" are used to setup I2C communication; "app.c/h" stands for CDC communication between PIC32 and Mac Terminal and are the major important codes in this project; "main.c" is just the main function that controls "app.c". Besides, system configuration codes generated by Harmony should also be adjusted for function clarification.
